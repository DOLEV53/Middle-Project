<div id="id_mardi">Mardi Gras FAQ: Answers to the most common questions about Carnival</div>
<div id="id_gras">Although many people around the world have heard of Mardi Gras, there are many questions that surround the event for
people who do not live in New Orleans. Below is a list of the most frequently asked questions about Mardi Gras. Still
have questions?<a href="http://127.0.0.1:5500/contact.html" id="id_contact" target="_blank">Contact us</a> and we'll be sure to answer you as soon as possible.
</div>
<div class="container">
<button class="accordion">What is Mardi Gras and why is it celebrated?</button>
<div class="panel">
    <p>Mardi Gras dates back thousands of years to pagan celebrations of spring and fertility. When Christianity arrived in
    Rome, religious leaders decided to incorporate the popular tradition into the new faith, so the excess and debauchery of
    the Carnival season became a prelude to Lent, the 40 days of penance between Ash Wednesday and Easter. Mardi Gras marks
    the final day of feasting and revelry before the fasting, prayer and moderation of Lent. So, in its most basic form,
    Carnival and Mardi Gras is all about overindulging.
    
    The first Carnival season made its way to the United States via the French. Many historians say the first American Mardi
    Gras was on March 3, 1699, when French explorers Bienville and Iberville landed in Louisiana. As the years passed, the
    holiday became more lavish -- and more festive.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">When is Mardi Gras?</button>
<div class="panel">
    <p>Mardi Gras is French for Fat Tuesday, the day before Ash Wednesday, or the beginning of Lent. The term refers to the
    last chance to eat rich, fatty foods - and for many, the last chance to drink copious amounts of alcohol -- before the
    Lenten season and its penance, which for many includes giving up something for the 40 days between Ash Wednesday and
    Easter.
    
    A common misconception is that Mardi Gras is the name for all of the revelry that begins Jan. 6 and continues through
    Ash Wednesday. This season of revelry is called Carnival; Mardi Gras is the culmination of it all.
    
    The day Carnival season officially begins, Jan. 6, is the Feast of the Epiphany, also known as Twelfth Night or Kings
    Day. Traditionally, this is the day the first king cakes are eaten.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">What is king cake all about?</button>
<div class="panel">
    <p>King cakes are traditionally served for the first time on Jan. 6, or Kings Day, and are enjoyed throughout the Carnival
    season. A traditional king cake is a braided cinnamon-laced brioche-like cake topped with icing and colored sugars:
    purple, green and gold, symbolizing justice, faith and power.
    
    Other cultures celebrate Jan. 6 with king cakes as well: In England in the early 19th century, for example, people would
    eat bits of the "twelfth night cake" in hopes of finding a bean or pea. Whoever found the bean would get to masquerade
    as a king or queen for the night. In some Spanish-speaking countries, beans or peas are still used.Many bakeries now
    offer king cakes with fillings of fruit, cream cheese, even chocolate. A small plastic baby is placed inside the cake to
    symbolize the baby Jesus; the person who gets the piece of cake with the baby is responsible for buying the next king
    cake, usually within the next week.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Is New Orleans the only place Mardi Gras is celebrated?</button>
<div class="panel">
    <p>Absolutely not! New Orleans might have the biggest parades and biggest parties throughout the Carnival season, but other
    cities across Louisiana, including Baton Rouge, join in on the fun. Mobile, Ala., also holds a big Mardi Gras
    celebration.
    
    Outside Louisiana, the most well-known festivals are in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil; Cologne, Germany; and Italy.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Is Mardi Gras family-friendly?</button>
<div class="panel">
    <p>"Everybody I know brings their kids to the Quarter and the Marigny on Fat Tuesday. It's a very fun, family time in
    costume. It's easy to steer away from Bourbon Street crowds when you have a stroller and a good costume." - Chris
    Waddington, NOLA.com | The Times-Picayune staff writer
    
    He's right. Not only are kids OK -- with discretion -- in the French Quarter on Mardi Gras, but the whole Carnival
    season is kid-friendly. Most parades are family-friendly. In fact, the Uptown parade route and the suburban parades are
    packed with families that build their whole days around the Carnival parade schedule.
    
    Although crowds can get tight and there is the occasional bad egg, much of the boozy crowds stick to Bourbon Street,
    which is home to the huge drag queen contest, where costumes are elaborate, and often fairly raunchy. And contrary to
    the beliefs of many Mardi Gras novices, women aren't likely to bare all in family-friendly areas.</p>
  </div>
<button class="accordion">What's a krewe and how do I join one?</button>
<div class="panel">
    <p>A Mardi Gras krewe is an organization that puts on a parade and/or a ball during the Carnival season. Krewe members pay
    annual dues, which finance the krewe's activities. Many krewes also participate in public service projects throughout
    the year in New Orleans.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Is there a dress code for a Mardi Gras ball? What about for parades?</button>
<div class="panel">
    <p>The traditional Mardi Gras ball is a lavish affair, calling for floor-length gowns for women and tuxedos for men.
    
    For the parades leading up to Mardi Gras, it's casual, comfortable attire.
    
    On Mardi Gras, however, costuming is expected. Many New Orleanians go for the satirical, the ironic, the bizarre or just
    something pretty. Costumes are by no means a requirement, but Mardi Gras is a great time to join the fun. Often,
    families or groups of friends will don a group-themed costume. Often, the best costumes tend to riff on current events.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Can I go to a Mardi Gras ball?</button>
<div class="panel">
    <p>That depends on whom you know. Most balls are invitation-only events, though tickets for some of the newer krewes' balls
    are available to the public for a steep fee. The Rex ball, for example, is invitation-only, but the Krewe of Endymion
    and the Krewe of Cleopatra offer tickets to their parties, which include live music, dancing, food and drink.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">What's with the beads?</button>
<div class="panel">
    <p>Parade-goers in New Orleans aren't just spectators; they are full participants in the spectacle. Each parade krewe is
    expected to toss beads and other trinkets from their floats, which means parade-goers go home with bags of loot. There
    are urban legends of New Orleanians having to reinforce their attics to support the weight of the beads caught during
    Carnival.
    
    A word of caution: Beads are worn only during Carnival, and then, only if you've just come from a parade. Tourists
    identify themselves by wearing beads in the off-season.
    </p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">In Baton Rouge, what's with all the flamingos at the parades?</button>
<div class="panel">
    <p>Pink flamingos are an integral part of the Spanish Town Parade, which rolls the weekend before Mardi Gras in Baton
    Rouge. Flamingos are the somewhat official mascot of the Spanish Town residents. Residents of this historic Baton Rouge
    community have traditionally bonded over their differences, a fact those residents are proud to recognize.
    
    "Today, the neighborhood still has a unique sense of community -- a sense of difference. To symbolize our difference
    from the rest of Baton Rouge, my neighbors and I have adopted the pink flamingo as our mascot," writes Jocelyn Donlon on
    The Spanish Town Mardi Gras website.
    
    Spanish Town resident Charles Fisher says he was there for the beginning of the flamingo craze, which began in the early
    1980s.
    
    "I do remember talk of 'this is tacky, that is tacky' and so on," Fisher wrote in an email to NOLA.com. "(Spanish Town
    resident) Clyde Carlson (found) an ad for flamingos in Old House Magazine that was headed 'RUIN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD.'
    Several of us then placed our orders and away it went. The old flyers from the early 1980s and all my letters always
    read 'Plant a Flamingo'."
    
    Spanish Town was planned in 1805 and is the oldest neighborhood in Baton Rouge. The area is marked by narrow streets,
    old buildings, little parking and lots of history.
